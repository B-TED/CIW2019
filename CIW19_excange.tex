Although many users of cryptocurrency exchanges demonstrate confidence in this simple role for an exchange, recent security incidents suggest that a gap

between the perception of users and the reality.
% of the cryptocurrency exchange management.
%That is, what kinds of operations are conducted, what are the informational asset to be protected, and what kinds of security postures are required.
%That is, operations, informational asset to be protected, and security postures should be clarified.
In this paper, we summarize the results of an investigation of

32 cryptocurrency exchanges by Japanese regulators, then analyze the reality of functionalities, implementation, and operations of
