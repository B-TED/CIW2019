\section{Conclusion}
Giving the unfortunate occurences of huge incidents at cryptocurrency exchanges, Japan is the most advanced country to deal with cryptocurrency governance issues. In spite of the advanced regulation on the exchanges in Japan, investigations by JFSA after the incidents reveal the shortage of technical, operational, and governance expertise.
The analysis implies the needs of a feedback loop for continuous enhancement (Kaizen Loop). We conducted modeling and risk analysis on the cryptocurrency exchange, aligning to ISO/IEC 27000, and created an example system and key management model. We found that the key lifecycle and management model is largely different from ordinary PKI. We showed typical key management model from the analysis. Establishing a concrete kaizen loop and new key management especially for PoS, is essential to not re-invent the wheel and to make a healthy cryptocurrency ecosystem.
